
Course project for Coursera class "Getting and Cleaning Data" in *Data Science* specialization offered by *Johns Hopkins University*.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

This repo includes the following files:  

- README.md  
- run_analysis.R - a script for performing the analysis.  
- CodeBook.md - a description of the variables, the data, and some transformations performed to clean up the data.  

run_analysis.R does the following:  

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.  
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.  
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.  
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.  
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
